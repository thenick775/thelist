# themovielist
A command line program to make a searchable list of movies, with tags and extendable fields

I built this because sadly, I watch so many movies that it became impossible for me to keep track of 
my favorites in my head.

This is a quick and dirty movie listing utility, that makes use of tui-go for formatting the window.

Future upgrades:
-Store file in compressed/binary format
-Pretty print and color output
-Minimize memory consumption when list is very large
