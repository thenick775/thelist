# thelist
A command line program to make a searchable list, with tags and extendable fields

I built this because sadly, I watch so many movies and read so many books that it became impossible for me to keep track of 
my favorites in my head.

This is a quick and dirty listing utility, that makes use of tui-go for formatting the window.

The search utilizes regular expressions, which is the primary way I wanted to be able to filter and search
by names/multiple tags.

Future upgrades:

-Pretty print and color output
